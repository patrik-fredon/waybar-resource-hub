## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email me at info@fredonbytes.cloud. I take security seriously (even if I joke about everything else).

- Please do **not** open public issues for security problems.
- Responsible disclosure is appreciated and rewarded with eternal gratitude (and maybe a meme).

## Supported Versions

- v1.0.0 (current)

## Security Policy

- No backdoors, no spyware, no drama.
- If you find one, let me know. If you add one, I'll find you.
